## Examples

Here is the example of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it is.
<example>
	<user:input>
		Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
	</user:input>
	</score>4</score>
	<score_reasons>
	- BAD: in the vocalubary table it did not show the 
	japanese characters, the cells are just blank.
	- BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table. 
	- BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
	- BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]
	</score_reasons>
	<assistant:output>	
### Input
Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a table of vocabulary that might be helpful:

| Japanese	| Romaji	| English
|			| kuma		|bear
|			|tobira		|door
|			|mottai		|garbage
|			|naka		|inside/out
|			|suteru		|throw away
|			|tsurete	|bring/leave
|			|iru		|exist/be

Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Bears are at the door" and "Did you leave the garbage out?" We'll need to figure out how to connect them in Japanese.
For the first clause, we can start with the subject:. Where do you think we should go from there?
Remember, I won't give away the answer, but I'll provide clues to help you work through it!

## Student Input
